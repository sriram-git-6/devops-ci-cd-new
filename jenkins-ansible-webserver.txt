git-->jenkins-->sending files over ssh to ansible server--->ansible builds images and pushes to docker hub. 

1. take 3(jenkins,ansible,webserver) machines  and establish password less authentication between jenkins and ansible, jenkins and webserver and ansible and webserver.
2. install publish over ssh plugin 
3. managejenkins->configure system-->in publish over ssh section add all the ssh servers(jenkins,ansible,webserver).
4. name:jenkins, hostname:ip of jenkins server, username: jenkins or root, click on advanced and select password authentication and give the password of jenkins and click on test configuration.
5.in the same way u add ansible and webserver
6. push the code to the github.
7. now from git we have pushed all the code(3 files) to jenkins server now from jenkins server  we have to push to ansible server. 
8. in build section select send files or execute commands over ssh (this will come only when u install publish over ssh plugin).
9. ssh server
    ----> name: jenkins
    -----> exec command: rsync -avh /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/docker-webapp3/* root or jenkins@172.31.22.67:/opt(ip of ansible server)
10. build the project and check the files in ansible server.
11. now ansible will build the image and pushes to docker hub for that we need to add one more build step
    ssh server
    -----> name: ansible
    -----> exec command: 
           cd /opt
           docker image build -t $JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_NO
           docker image tag $JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_NO 656788/$JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_NO
           docker image tag $JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_NO 656788/$JOB_NAME:latest
           "before pushing the image to the docker hub you have to login" docker login
           docker image push 656788/$JOB_NAME:latest 
           docker image push 656788/$JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_NO
           docker image rmi $JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_NO 656788/$JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_NO 656788/$JOB_NAME:latest
12. now you have to deploy the image and run container in webserver from ansible for that write the playbook in ansible machine.
13. In the /etc/ansible/hosts inventory create a group called webserver and mention the ip of the webserver.
14. write ansible playbook in ansible server for creating the container or u can put it in the git.
15. now go to jenkins add build step select send files or execute commands over ssh
    ssh server
    -------> name: ansible
    -------> exec command:
             ansible-playbook /opt/ansible.yml 
16. lets integrate with git means use git webhook
     in settings got git webhooks:

     payload url: jenkins url/github-webhook
     content type: application/json
     secret: 
         for generating the secret go to jenkins dashboard-->configure--add token -->click on generate.
         copy the generated token and provide it in secret and click on add webhook.
         webhook sends api request to jenkins shows tick mark indicating it is integrated with jenkins.
17. now go to git and based on the new commit jenkins should run so make some changes in the docker file it automatically triggers.
